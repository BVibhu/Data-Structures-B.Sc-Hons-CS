14. WAP to create a Binary Search Tree and include following operations in tree:
  1. Insertion (Recursive and Iterative Implementation)
  2. Deletion by copying
  3. Deletion by Merging
  4. Search a no. in BST
  5. Display its preorder, postorder and inorder traversals Recursively

  8. Count the non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes
  9. Display height of tree
  10. Create a mirror image of tree
  11. Check whether two BSTs are equal or not
15. WAP to convert the Sparse Matrix into non-zero form and vice-versa.
16. WAP to reverse the order of the elements in the stack using additional stack.
17. WAP to reverse the order of the elements in the stack using additional Queue.
